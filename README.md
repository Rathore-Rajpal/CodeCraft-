## Installation & Setup üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites

- **XAMPP**: Make sure you have XAMPP installed to run the PHP server and MySQL database. Download it from [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).

   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/CodeCraft.git
   ```

2. **Start XAMPP**: 
   - Open XAMPP and start **Apache** and **MySQL** modules.

3. **Database Setup**:
   - Open phpMyAdmin (`http://localhost/phpmyadmin`) and create a database named `users`.
   - Import the provided SQL file (`database.sql`) to create the necessary tables (`admininfo`, `feedback`, `userqueries`, `users`).

4. **Configure the Project**:
   - Place the project folder in the `htdocs` directory of XAMPP.
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/CodeCraft`.

5. **User & Admin Login**:
   - You can now register new users or log in as an admin using the credentials provided in the SQL dump.

## Database Structure üìä

The MySQL database includes the following tables:
- **admininfo**: Stores admin login details.
- **users**: Maintains user profiles, including username, email, password, and profile picture.
- **feedback**: Collects user feedback with responses from the admin.
- **userqueries**: Stores user queries and responses.
